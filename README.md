## Repository for all things related to the paper

## todos

- TODO: setup template

- TODO: more simulations, with different material

- TODO: research materials, section on why one material over the other, comparison of simulation results

- TODO: constraints, specification: how much/which load should the part be able to take, design limitations, size constraints, etc

- TODO: Determine scientific question

    - The use of this material vs that material for the construction of x part
    
    - What are the most important considerations when designing cost-effective parts for robots?

    - Are 3d printed parts sufficient for a rover chassis?

    - Are aluminum parts preferable over 3d printed parts for simple robotics projects?

    - Is it worth using a standalone BLDC motor controller over a proprietary motor controller?

    - Viability of 3d printing as a method of producing parts for the Rover to Mars project.

        - Thesis: Yes, 3 printing is a suitable method for this purpose
