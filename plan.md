# Viability of 3d printing as a method of producing parts for the Rover to Mars for the rover to mars project

## Thesis: Yes, 3d printing is a suitable method for this purpose

## What components were 3D printed?

- Chassis Body Corners
- Supsension Rocker
- Chassis-Rocker Connector
- Supsension Boogie
- Whole Differential

## What components still have to be 3D printed?

- Servo Mount
- Middle Wheel Adapter


## What componets were manufactured out of Aluminium?

- Motor-Wheel Shaft
- Rocker Axle
- Boogie Axle

## What components still have to be manufactured out of Aluminium?

- Motor Cover
- Wheel Hub
- Middle Wheel Axle


### Analysis criterea

Compare what we need vs what we have from the method

- Rigidity of the parts

    - Requirements for the project

- Surface quality

    - Requirements for the project


- Tensile strength

    - Requirements for the project

- How fast can we get the parts done

- Cost

- Precision

- Complexity of the process

- Thermal properties

- Extra: environmental impact of the production parts, recyclability
