# Precision

Dimensional Accuracy

3D Printing (Prusa MK4):

- Typical Tolerance: ±0.1 mm to ±0.2 mm depending on the printer settings and filament quality.
- Influencing Factors: Layer height, print speed, nozzle diameter, and calibration.
- Example Source: Prusa's specifications and user experiences indicate that well-calibrated printers can achieve high accuracy for most hobbyist and professional applications.

6061 T6 Aluminum Manufacturing (CNC Machining or Milling):

- Typical Tolerance: ±0.005 mm to ±0.02 mm depending on the machining process and equipment precision.
- Influencing Factors: Tool wear, machine calibration, and thermal expansion.
- Example Source: Industry standards and machining guides often cite these tolerances for CNC machined aluminum parts.

Repeatability

3D Printing (Prusa MK4):

- Good repeatability with the same print settings, but slight variations can occur due to filament quality and environmental conditions.

6061 T6 Aluminum Manufacturing:

- High repeatability with CNC machining, ensuring nearly identical parts within specified tolerances.

Complexity and Customization

3D Printing (Prusa MK4):

- Complex Geometries: Capable of producing complex shapes and internal structures that are difficult or impossible to machine.
- Customization: Easy and cost-effective to customize and iterate designs.

6061 T6 Aluminum Manufacturing:

- Complex Geometries: Limited by machining capabilities, may require multiple setups or specialized equipment.
- Customization: More expensive and time-consuming to change designs once tooling is set up.

# Complexity of the process

- Compare the difference between just loading an STL file on to Prusa and having not only having a design on Fusion360,  but also make a technical drawing out of it, have implemented tolerances and also having to hand it in to an engineer where they review your drawing, may correct it, go home, make the corrections, send it back to them, they approve, then get put on a list until your component can be made. 

# Thermal properties

3D Printing PLA:
- Melting Point: 145-160 ˚C
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 68-100 x 10⁻⁶ per °C
- Thermal Degradation: Begins above 200°C

6061 T6 Aluminium:
- Melting Point: 582 - 652 °C
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 23.6 x 10⁻⁶ per °C
- Thermal Degradation: Does not degrade at typical operational temperatures

# Extra: environmental impact of the production parts, how recyclable the parts are

Environmental Impact

3D Printing with PLA:

- Material Source: Derived from renewable resources (e.g., corn starch, sugarcane).
- Energy Consumption: Generally lower than traditional manufacturing, especially for small batches.
- Waste Generation: Minimal waste due to additive manufacturing process.
- End-of-Life:
    - Biodegradable under industrial composting conditions.
    - Limited biodegradability in typical landfill environments.

Manufacturing with 6061 T6 Aluminum:

- Material Source: Extracted from bauxite ore, involving energy-intensive mining and refining.
- Energy Consumption: Higher due to large machinery and energy required for mining and refining.
- Waste Generation: Significant waste from subtractive manufacturing processes (metal shavings, off-cuts).
- End-of-Life:
    - Highly recyclable without property degradation.
    - Recycling aluminum uses only about 5% of the energy required to produce new aluminum.

Recyclability:

- PLA: Biodegradable and recyclable under specific conditions, but infrastructure limitations reduce practical recyclability.
- 6061 T6 Aluminum: Highly recyclable with a well-established process, conserving significant energy and maintaining material properties.
