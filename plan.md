# Viability of 3d printing as a method of producing parts for the Rover to Mars for the rover to mars project

## Thesis: Yes, 3d printing is a suitable method for this purpose

## What components were 3D printed?

- Chassis Body Corners
- Supsension Rocker
- Chassis-Rocker Connector
- Supsension Boogie
- Whole Differential

## What components still have to be 3D printed?

- Servo Mount
- Middle Wheel Adapter


## What componets were manufactured out of Aluminium?

- Motor-Wheel Shaft
- Rocker Axle
- Boogie Axle

## What components still have to be manufactured out of Aluminium?

- Motor Cover
- Wheel Hub
- Middle Wheel Axle


### Analysis criterea

Compare what we need vs what we have from the method

# Elasticity of the parts

    - Requirements for the project

    3D Printing PLA:
    - Young's Modulus: 3.5 MPa
    - Elongation at break: Not found yet
    - Melting Point: 145-160 ˚C

    6061 T6 Aluminium:
    - Young's Modulus: 68.9 MPa
    - Elongation at break: Not found yet
    - Melting Point: 582 - 652 °C


# Surface quality

    - Requirements for the project

    - TBC


# Tensile strength

    - Requirements for the project

    - Ultimate Tensile Stength for 3D printing PLA: 60 MPa
    - Ultimate Tensile Stength 6061 T6 Aluminium: 310 MPa


    

# How fast can we get the parts done

- TBC

# Cost

Made from 3D Printing PLA:

- 4x Motor-Wheel Shaft: €0.76
- 2x Rocker Axle: €1.92
- 2x Boogie Axle: €1.48

Total: €4.16

Made from 6061 T6 Aluminium:

- 4x Motor-Wheel Shaft
- 2x Rocker Axle
- 2x Boogie Axle

Total: €201.28

# Precision

- TBC

# Complexity of the process

- Compare the difference between just loading an STL file on to Prusa and having not only having a design on Fusion360,  but also make a technical drawing out of it, have implemented tolerances and also having to hand it in to an engineer where they review your drawing, may correct it, go home, make the corrections, send it back to them, they approve, then get put on a list until your component can be made. 

# Thermal properties

    3D Printing PLA:
    - Melting Point: 145-160 ˚C
    - Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 68-100 x 10⁻⁶ per °C
    - Thermal Degradation: Begins above 200°C

    6061 T6 Aluminium:
    - Melting Point: 582 - 652 °C
    - Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 23.6 x 10⁻⁶ per °C
    - Thermal Degradation: Does not degrade at typical operational temperatures

# Extra: environmental impact of the production parts, recyclability
- TBC
