# Viability of 3d printing as a method of producing parts for the Rover to Mars for the rover to mars project

## Thesis: Yes, 3d printing is a suitable method for this purpose

### Analysis criterea

Compare what we need vs what we have from the method

- Rigidity of the parts

    - Requirements for the project

- Surface quality

    - Requirements for the project


- Tensile strength

    - Requirements for the project

- How fast can we get the parts done

- Cost

- Precision

- Complexity of the process

- Thermal properties

- Extra: environmental impact of the production parts, recyclability
